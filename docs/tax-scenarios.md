## Implementation Notes

When building these into the simulation:

1. **Pre-populate all form data** - Students observe calculations, not data entry
2. **Step-by-step walkthrough mode** - Pause at each calculation with explanations
3. **"What-if" toggles:**
   - Scenario 1: "What if Alex was claimed as a dependent?"
   - Scenario 2: "What if Jordan tracked expenses vs standard mileage?"
   - Scenario 3: "What if Maria filed as Single instead of HoH?"
4. **Side-by-side comparisons** - Show standard vs itemized, different filing statuses
5. **IRS form line references** - "This appears on Form 1040, Line 11"
6. **Glossary links** - Click any term to see definition
7. **Print summary** - Generate a simplified "tax return" students can review
