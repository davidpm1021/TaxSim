# TaxSim: Educational Tax Filing Simulation

## Summary for Curriculum Designers

### What Is It?
TaxSim is an interactive web-based simulation that mirrors the experience of filing federal income taxes (similar to TurboTax) without requiring real personal information or actually filing anything. Students work through a guided interview-style flow, entering fictional tax data and seeing how each decision affects their final tax outcome.

### Target Audience
- High school students (grades 10-12)
- Financial literacy or personal finance courses
- College prep / life skills programs
- Ages 15-18

### Educational Goals
By completing the simulation, students will be able to:
1. **Read and interpret** common tax forms (W-2, 1099s, 1098-T)
2. **Understand** the difference between gross income, AGI, and taxable income
3. **Explain** how tax brackets work (progressive taxation)
4. **Compare** standard vs. itemized deductions
5. **Distinguish** between tax credits and tax deductions
6. **Calculate** why someone receives a refund or owes money
7. **Recognize** special situations: self-employment, dependents, education benefits

### How It Works
Students progress through sections that mirror a real tax return:

| Section | What Students Do |
|---------|------------------|
| **Welcome** | Learn simulation is safe, no real data needed |
| **Personal Info** | Choose filing status, indicate dependents |
| **Income** | Enter W-2 wages, 1099 income (freelance, interest, dividends) |
| **Adjustments** | Apply above-the-line deductions (student loans, HSA) |
| **Deductions** | Compare standard vs. itemized; see SALT cap, medical threshold |
| **Credits** | Apply Child Tax Credit, education credits, EITC |
| **Review** | See complete picture before final calculation |
| **Results** | View refund/owed amount with full breakdown |

Each section includes **"Learn More"** tooltips explaining tax concepts in student-friendly language.

## The Three Teaching Scenarios

### Scenario 1: College Student with Multiple Income Sources
**Alex Martinez, Age 20, Single**

| What They Have | Teaching Concept |
|----------------|------------------|
| Part-time job (W-2: $12,500) | Reading a W-2, understanding withholding |
| Savings account interest ($85) | 1099-INT, passive income |
| Investment dividends ($320) | 1099-DIV, qualified vs. ordinary |
| Tuition payments (1098-T) | Education credits (AOTC) |
| Student loan payments | Above-the-line deductions |

**Outcome:** $1,750 total refund (federal + state)

**Key Lesson:** Even with low income, filing gets your withholding back AND you may qualify for refundable education credits.

### Scenario 2: Gig Economy Worker
**Jordan Chen, Age 24, Single, Freelance + Rideshare**

| What They Have | Teaching Concept |
|----------------|------------------|
| Web design clients (1099-NEC: $19,500) | Self-employment income |
| Rideshare driving (1099-K: $18,200) | Platform income reporting |
| Business expenses (mileage, supplies) | Schedule C deductions |
| No taxes withheld | Why freelancers owe at tax time |
| HSA contribution | Tax-advantaged savings |

**Outcome:** Owes $4,292

**Key Lesson:** Self-employed workers pay BOTH halves of Social Security/Medicare (15.3%), must track expenses, and should pay quarterly estimated taxes.

---

### Scenario 3: Single Parent (Head of Household)
**Maria Santos, Age 32, 3 Children**

| What They Have | Teaching Concept |
|----------------|------------------|
| Nursing job (W-2: $58,000) | W-2 with 401(k), HSA codes |
| Three children (ages 4, 7, 16) | Dependents, Child Tax Credit |
| Mortgage, property taxes | Itemized deduction comparison |
| Medical expenses | 7.5% AGI threshold |
| Head of Household status | Better brackets than Single |

**Outcome:** $12,147 federal refund

**Key Lesson:** Tax credits (CTC, EITC) directly reduce tax owed and can be partially refundable. Filing status matters—Head of Household gets better treatment than Single.

## Concepts Covered Across All Scenarios

### Income Types
- W-2 (employee wages)
- 1099-NEC (freelance/contractor)
- 1099-K (payment apps, rideshare)
- 1099-INT (bank interest)
- 1099-DIV (investment dividends)

### Key Tax Terms
| Term | Simple Definition |
|------|-------------------|
| **Gross Income** | All money received before any subtractions |
| **AGI (Adjusted Gross Income)** | Gross income minus certain deductions (student loans, HSA) |
| **Taxable Income** | AGI minus standard or itemized deduction—this is what gets taxed |
| **Tax Bracket** | The percentage rate applied to portions of your income |
| **Withholding** | Taxes already paid through your paycheck |
| **Refund** | You paid more than you owed; IRS sends the difference back |
| **Tax Credit** | Dollar-for-dollar reduction in tax owed (better than deduction) |
| **Tax Deduction** | Reduces taxable income, not tax directly |

### Filing Statuses Demonstrated
- Single
- Head of Household
- (Married Filing Jointly discussed in comparisons)

### Deductions & Credits
| Type | Examples in Scenarios |
|------|----------------------|
| **Standard Deduction** | $15,750 (Single), $23,625 (HoH) |
| **Itemized Deductions** | Mortgage interest, state taxes (SALT), charitable gifts, medical |
| **Above-the-Line** | Student loan interest, HSA contributions, 1/2 SE tax |
| **Credits** | Child Tax Credit, EITC, American Opportunity Credit |

## Suggested Worksheet Activities

### Before the Simulation
1. **Vocabulary matching** - Match tax terms to definitions
2. **W-2 scavenger hunt** - Find specific boxes on a sample W-2
3. **Filing status quiz** - Given family situations, identify correct status

### During the Simulation
1. **Guided walkthrough** - Students complete one scenario together as a class
2. **Prediction checkpoints** - "Before clicking next, predict: refund or owe?"
3. **Calculation verification** - Manually verify one tax bracket calculation

### After the Simulation
1. **Scenario comparison** - Why did Jordan owe while Maria got a huge refund?
2. **What-if analysis** - "What if Alex was claimed as a dependent by parents?"
3. **Real-world connection** - "Which scenario is most like your future situation?"
4. **Reflection questions:**
   - Why do employers withhold taxes from paychecks?
   - What's the advantage of a tax credit over a tax deduction?
   - Why might someone choose to itemize instead of taking the standard deduction?
